# Stocks analysis

## Overview of Project
### Assessing stock performance over a two year period (2017 - 2018)
The goal of this project is to analyze stocks trade volume, as well as average rate of return for twelve popular ticker symbols. Additionally, using VBA script in Excel, we automated various aspects of our analysis, which can easily be re-used for data that may be obtained in for later years or for other ticker symbols.

Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.



## Summary
In a summary statement, address the following questions.
1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
